        A list of dilations to use. Default is ``[1, 2, ..., 10]``.  A
        good alternative is ``[1, 2, 4, 8]``. The dilations are
        repeated when there are more layers than supplied dilations.

        :param loss: `string`

        A string describing the loss function that should be
        used. Currently, the following losses are supported:

        * "L1" - ``nn.L1Loss()``
        * "L2" - ``nn.MSELoss()``

        :param parallel: `bool`

        Whether or not to execute the model on multiple GPUs.  Note
        that the batch size must be a multiple of the number of
        available GPUs.

        :param ndim: `int`

        The dimension of the convolutions. 2D convolutions are used by
        default. 3D is also possible.
